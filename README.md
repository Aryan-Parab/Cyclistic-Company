The bike-sharing company wants to analyze their user data to find the main differences in behaviour between their two types of users — casual riders, who pay for each ride, and annual members, who pay a yearly subscription.

The company’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Now, the company wants to design marketing strategies aimed at converting their casual riders into annual members.

To do that, we need to analyze the company’s user data to find the main differences in behaviour between these two types of users, or, in other words, to answer the question:
What could motivate casual riders to change to an annual subscription based on their behavior?
